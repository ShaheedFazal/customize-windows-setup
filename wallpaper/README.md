Place your `wallpaper.png` image in this directory. Optionally include a
`WallpaperSettings` file generated by BGInfo for custom overlays.
`ZZZ-Deploy-BGInfo.ps1` applies the wallpaper. If BGInfo is missing it is downloaded automatically.
This script schedules BGInfo at logon to keep the overlay up to date.
