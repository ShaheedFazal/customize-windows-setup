Place your `wallpaper.png` image in this directory. Optionally include a
`WallpaperSettings` file generated by BGInfo for custom overlays.
`ZZZ-Set-Wallpaper.ps1` applies the wallpaper. If BGInfo is missing it is downloaded automatically.
The script also creates a Startup entry so the wallpaper reloads at logon.
