## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Safety Information

**This toolkit performs extensive system modifications.** Before proceeding:

- ‚úÖ **Create a complete system backup** or VM snapshot
- ‚úÖ **Ensure you have a local administrator account** (essential if currently using Microsoft account)
- ‚úÖ **Review all scripts** in the `includes` folder to understand changes
- ‚úÖ **Test on a non-production system first**
- ‚úÖ **Close all running applications** before execution

The toolkit includes automatic restore point creation and registry backup, but these are **not substitutes for proper system backups**.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Method 1: One-Command Installation

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and execute:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaheedFazal/customize-windows-setup/main/download-repo.ps1 | iex; & `"$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\customize-windows-setup\customize-windows-setup-main\customize-windows-client.ps1`""
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**
2. **Set execution policy:**
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
   ```
3. **Download repository:**
   ```powershell
   $downloadPath = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE 'Downloads'
   iwr -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaheedFazal/customize-windows-setup/main/download-repo.ps1' -OutFile (Join-Path $downloadPath 'download-repo.ps1')
   & "$downloadPath\download-repo.ps1"
   ```
4. **Execute the toolkit:**
   ```powershell
   cd "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\customize-windows-setup\customize-windows-setup-main"
   .\customize-windows-client.ps1
   ```
   The script runs **interactively** and will pause for user input at several steps.
   If it appears to stop, look for a prompt at the bottom of the PowerShell window.

## üîß Customisation & Configuration

### Feature Toggle System

**Enable/Disable Features:**
- Move scripts between `includes/` and `includes/disabled/` folders
- Scripts in `disabled/` folder are completely skipped
- No code modification required for feature toggling

**Execution Order Control:**
- Scripts execute alphabetically
- Use `ZZ-` prefix for scripts requiring dependencies (e.g., `ZZ-Enable-BitLocker.ps1`)
- Dependency-aware execution ensures proper setup sequence

### Configuration Variables

Modify variables in `customize-windows-client.ps1`:

```powershell
$DRIVELABELSYS = "OS"                      # System drive label
$TEMPFOLDER = "C:\Temp"                    # Logging and temporary files
$INSTALLFOLDER = "C:\Install"              # Installation files and backups
$POWERMANAGEMENT = "High performance"       # Preferred power plan
$DRIVELETTERCDROM = "z:"                   # CD-ROM drive letter assignment
```

### Advanced Customisation Options

**Wallpaper Personalisation:**
1. Add your image as `wallpaper/wallpaper.png`.
2. (Optional) place a `WallpaperSettings` file created by BGInfo in the same folder.
3. Run `ZZZ-Set-Wallpaper.ps1` to apply the wallpaper. The script downloads BGInfo if missing and uses the settings file to generate the wallpaper.
4. The script sets up a startup task so the wallpaper reloads automatically at logon.

**Microsoft Edge Policies:**
- 18 configurable policies in `Debloat-MicrosoftEdge.ps1`
- Granular control over telemetry, features, and integrations
- Enterprise-grade configuration options

## üîç Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues & Solutions

**App Removal Errors (HRESULT: 0x80073CFA):**
- Indicates apps already removed or partially uninstalled
- Generally harmless and can be safely ignored
- Script includes error handling for these scenarios

**Script Execution Policy Restrictions:**
```powershell
# Temporary bypass for current session
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force

# Or run with bypass flag
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .\customize-windows-client.ps1
```

**Winget Installation Failures:**
- Toolkit automatically installs winget if missing
- Requires internet connection for Microsoft Store App Installer
- Falls back gracefully if automatic installation fails

**Microsoft Account Lockout Prevention:**
- Toolkit detects existing Microsoft accounts
- Prompts for local account creation before proceeding
- Warns about potential lockout scenarios

-**File Association Issues:**
- Ensure `SetUserFTA.exe` downloaded successfully to `C:\Scripts\`. The toolkit falls back to a registry method and then `assoc` if needed
- Verify target applications installed correctly
- Run file association scripts after application installation
- **Parsing Errors After Manual Extraction:**
  - Some third-party unzip tools can corrupt PowerShell files
  - Re-download using the provided `download-repo.ps1` script or `Expand-Archive`
  - Confirm `Profile-Template-Functions.ps1` contains around 430 lines
  - If issues persist, clone the repo using `git clone` to avoid line-ending corruption

### Recovery Procedures

**Restore Microsoft Account Access:**
```powershell
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v NoConnectedUser /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v BlockUserFromCreatingAccounts /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\UserProfileEngagement" /v ScoobeSystemSettingEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\PassportForWork" /v Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

**System Restore Options:**
- **System Restore Point:** Created automatically before modifications
- **Registry Backups:** Saved to `C:\Install\registry-backup-*.reg`
- **Log Files:** Complete execution log at `C:\Temp\customize-windows-client-*.log`

### Diagnostic Information

**Log Analysis:**
