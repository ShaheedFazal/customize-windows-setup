A comprehensive collection of PowerShell scripts designed to automate Windows post-installation customization, debloating, privacy hardening, and system optimization. This toolkit transforms a fresh Windows installation into a streamlined, privacy-focused, and performance-optimized system with minimal manual intervention.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository addresses common pain points with fresh Windows installations by providing:
- **Automated debloating** - Removes unwanted pre-installed applications and services
- **Privacy hardening** - Disables telemetry, advertising, and data collection features
- **Performance optimization** - Applies system tweaks for better responsiveness
- **Security enhancements** - Configures Windows Defender, BitLocker, and security policies
- **User experience improvements** - Customizes Explorer, taskbar, and system behaviors
- **Enterprise-ready configuration** - Suitable for both home users and enterprise environments

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety First

**CRITICAL:** These scripts make extensive system modifications. Before running:

1. **Create a system backup** or use a virtual machine for testing
2. **Review all scripts** in the `includes/` directory to understand changes
3. **Test on non-production systems** first
4. **Run PowerShell as Administrator** for proper execution
5. **Understand rollback procedures** - system restore points are created but have limitations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Method 1: One-Line Installation (Recommended)

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and execute:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; `
    iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaheedFazal/customize-windows-setup/main/download-repo.ps1 | iex; `
    & "C:\Temp\customize-windows-setup\customize-windows-setup-main\customize-windows-client.ps1"
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download and run `download-repo.ps1` to extract the repository to `C:\Temp`
2. Navigate to the extracted folder
3. Execute `customize-windows-client.ps1` as Administrator

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

```
customize-windows-setup/

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AGENTS.md                      # Development guidelines
```

### Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**: Creates system restore point, sets up logging
2. **Registry Backup**: Backs up critical registry hives (HKLM, HKCR, HKU)
3. **Script Discovery**: Loads all `.ps1` files from `includes/` (excluding `disabled/`)
4. **Sequential Execution**: Runs scripts alphabetically, with `ZZZ-` prefixed scripts last
5. **Multi-User Application**: Applies changes to current user, all loaded profiles, and default template
6. **Error Handling**: Logs failures and continues execution where possible

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Registry Policy Migration
The toolkit uses **HKLM (Local Machine)** policies instead of **HKCU (Current User)** settings to ensure:
- System-wide application across all user accounts
- Resistance to user-level changes
- Consistent behavior for new user accounts
- Enterprise policy compliance

- **System Restore Points**: Creates restoration checkpoints
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- **Rollback Documentation**: Clear instructions for reversing changes

## üé® Customization

### Enabling/Disabling Features
- Move scripts to `includes/disabled/` to skip execution
- Modify `customize-windows-client.ps1` variables for different configurations
- Edit individual scripts for custom behaviors

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Scripts in the `disabled/` folder require careful review before enabling. These scripts may contain:
- Outdated or untested functionality
- Settings that conflict with active scripts
- Enterprise-specific configurations not suitable for all environments
- Features that have been disabled for compatibility reasons

Always test disabled scripts in a virtual machine or isolated environment before moving them to the active `includes/` folder.

### Adding New Features
1. Create new `.ps1` script in `includes/`
2. Use `Shared-Functions.ps1` utilities for consistency
3. Follow existing naming conventions
4. Test thoroughly before deployment

### Variables Configuration
Key variables in `customize-windows-client.ps1`:
```powershell
$DRIVELABELSYS = "OS"              # System drive label
$POWERMANAGEMENT = "High performance"  # Power plan
$OFFICESUITE = "Google"            # Default office suite preference
```

## üìä Logging & Monitoring

### Log Files
- **Main Log**: `C:\Temp\customize-windows-client-[timestamp].log`
- **Registry Backups**: `C:\Install\registry-backup-*`
- **Shared Log**: `C:\Temp\Customization.log` (via shared functions)

### Error Handling
- Non-blocking errors allow script continuation
